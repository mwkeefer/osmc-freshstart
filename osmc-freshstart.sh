#
# ** WARNING:  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
#

#
# * Tested with many packages including: lxde desktop (x desktop), tightvncserver, vim, zip, unzip, mate-desktop, transmission, etc.
#
#	[Example Test]
#
#	Using: sudo apt-get install tightvncserver transmission
#	Pre-install disk usage:						1611816960 Bytes Used, 5633810432 Bytes Free (from df -B1)
#	Packages installed:							97
#	Archives downloaded:						32.7 MB / 99 Archive Files
#	Apt-get indicated additional disk space:	120 MB
#	Post-install disk usage:					1777987584 Bytes Used, 5467639808 Bytes Free  (from df -B1)
#
#	Using: osmc-freshstart.sh and chosing remove package archives:
#	Packages removed:							97
#	Archives removed:							97
#	Post freshstart disk usage:					1613180928 Bytes Used,  5632446464 Bytes Free (from df -B1)
#
# 	*NOTE	Due to disk overheads like journaling, etc... the space available after cleanup will differ from pre-install by a small amount
#			this is normal and should not cause concern.
#	
# * NOTE: After entering Y to confirm package removal and When cleaning up a huge mess (multiple xdesktops, 
#	vnc, misc. apps installed on whim, xorg packages, etc) this script may take quite some time once it launches
#   apt. This is 100% normal and should be allowed to continue without interruption.
